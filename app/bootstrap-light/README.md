# Bootstrap-light
_The most popular front-end framework in a lightweight form_

## Work in progress, come back later.

### Why ?
_We love bootstrap because :_
- it's so well known
- it's so well tested
- it's so well crafted

But we really want a pure css framework that is more lightweight.  
Is it possible ? **Bootstrap-light** is my take on it.

### What are the trade-offs ?
I removed all javascript from the framework. That means that carousels, tooltips, dropdowns, modals and responsive navbars are not supported.  
I then removed some less used features of bootstrap that you can reenable if you wish by modifying the variables.scss and compiling it again.  
The result is a lightweight bootstrap that comes at 7kb gzipped out of the box with a lot of features and all the testing and knowledge of the parent framework.
