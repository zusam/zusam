## What is Zusam ?

Zusam (/tsuËˆzam/) is a free and open-source way to self-host private forums for
groups of friends. Composed of a server written in PHP exposing a REST API and a
lightweight webapp, Zusam is extensible and easy to install.  
The goal is to make a stable, extensible, lightweight and user-friendly way
to self-host private social groups.

## Features

- Video and image upload

- Public link generation for messages
- Completely responsive and mobile friendly
- Low server footprint

## Deployment

Zusam is composed of a PHP server and a single-page-application.
The backend uses [Symfony](https://symfony.com) and [Sqlite](https://sqlite.org),
the frontend is made with [Preact](https://preactjs.com) and [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org).

Requirements:

- PHP 8.1+ (with iconv, mbstring, curl, xml, sqlite3 and imagick extensions)
- Ffmpeg 3+

Installation guides:

- [Debian buster with nginx](documentation/debian-buster-nginx.md)
- [Debian buster with apache](documentation/debian-buster-apache.md)
- [Docker](documentation/docker.md)

## Status

The project has the goal of being really stable for the backend once `1.0` is hit.
That means no database structure changes, an update system and a stable API.  
The webapp can still change a lot after that point.  
For now, Zusam is completely usable in a day-to-day basis but is subject to significative
evolutions with upcoming updates and doesn't guarantee backwards compatibility.  
I try my best to make updates as easy as possible.

## Webapp compatibility

The webapp targets Firefox ESR and at most one-year old Chrome.  
It should work on the latest versions of Edge and Safari but is not tested on them.
